This is the prototype for a racing Engine written in Javascript

## Unstable

Right now this is very buggy, and I'm almost certain some of the files are missing as this project is quite old, but I'm hoping to continue work on it and get it back to a stage where it can be used for someting useful

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute, or request improvements to this project
